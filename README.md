# AJH_Missing_Tracks
This is a simple program that I wrote to find tracks that may be missing from my music collection.  It processes an input text file, and outputs limited track names that should be investigated manually.

This started when I realized that my media player was deleting track 1 from albums under certain circumstances.  That left me with a number of albums missing the first track.  My first attempt to locate these was to use regular expressions on a directory listing output to a text file.  That type of lookback was (at the time) beyond my ability, so I wrote this.  I showed this to my C++ teacher at the time, hoping for some extra credit.  He was pleased that I took this initiative to do this, but did not grant any extra credit.

I have a Java version of this project as well.
